# Nix

## Overview

Nix allows you to define the environment your code runs in, in a repeatable manor, so that you can easily distribute identical setups across a variety of environments. It's a package manager, configuration language, and even has its own OS if you want to dig that deep.

## Installation

### MacOS

```text
sh <(curl --location https://nixos.org/nix/install) --darwin-use-unencrypted-nix-store-volume
```
